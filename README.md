# Accordion Dependent

Accordion-Dependent provides a streamlined and interactive way to display FAQs, ensuring that only one item can be opened at a time. This approach prevents users from being overwhelmed by too much information at once, allowing them to focus on one question and answer pair before moving to the next.
